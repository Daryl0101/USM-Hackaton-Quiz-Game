This is one of my university first year project. It is a game which utilizes linked lists to store the data of the participants and utilizes queues to store the quiz questions from a .txt file. Specifications:- 
- Takes in unlimited amount of groups and unlimited amount of participants in each group.

- Questions can be customized by the user. - The participants will take turns to answer the quiz (G: Group, P: Player - G1P1, G2P1, G1P2, G2P2 . . .) 
- The game calculates the scores of each participants each time they answer a question. 
- The game tells the participant if their answers are correct; If the answer is incorrect, the system tells the user the correct answer.
